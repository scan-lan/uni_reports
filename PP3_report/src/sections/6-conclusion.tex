\section{Conclusion}
I'm pleased with my progress in these objectives over the last year. I've had much internal change to adapt to, and it has slowed my progress at times; however, I've had excellent support from my organisation and team to counteract it. This report has highlighted significant progress in my presentation skills, as well as helped me codify strategies and techniques to continue my development and attain comfort in talking for an audience; I've used my industry knowledge to guide research on processes common among all software development work, and presented my findings to a group of experienced colleagues, each of whom gave positive feedback; also, I've expanded my knowledge of AWS and Python---technologies I use every day at work, ones which will serve me well in my later career.

My aspirations for next year include becoming proficient with TypeScript---a language I've grown fond of---and working on web development once again, specifically with the React framework. I look forward to negotiating these objectives with the university and PPL.
