This report is a reflection by a graduate apprentice on development regarding four of eight objectives agreed between their workplace, People's Postcode Lottery, and their university, Edinburgh Napier University, at the start of the academic year; the objectives are a necessary part of the Professional Practice 2 module. Additionally, it includes their aims for the Professional Practice 3 module they will be undertaking next year.

The objectives covered here follow: \emph{use a range of communication skills}; \emph{gain experience and complete tickets demonstrating knowledge of AWS/CDK}; \emph{gain experience and understanding through ticket work of the development process and have a firm understanding of the development lifecycle}; \emph{gain experience and complete tickets demonstrating knowledge of Python}. The STAR-L framework is used to reflect on progress regarding the objectives, drawing on the apprentice's experience and learning from both workplace and university.

The report concludes that the apprentice is pleased with their progress, especially with regards to presentation skills. They highlight their development relating to technologies essential to their current organisation and note that the skills developed will serve them well in the future of their career. They also look forward to the next year and the skills they intend to acquire.
